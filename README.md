# 🧊 n4mlz's Dotfiles (new)

This is my Dotfiles repository managed by **chezmoi**, targeting **Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu**!
This also provides a set of CLI tools, and can be deployed to SSH-accessible servers, WSL, or containers.

## 🔗 Dependencies

## 🪶 Features

### ⚙️ Automatic CLI tool installation

CLI tool‑chain (such as **Starship**, **sheldon**, etc.) are installed automatically via chezmoi’s user‑script feature when you run `chezmoi apply`.

### 🛠️ CI‑based Installation Tests

GitHub Actions automatically verifies that these dotfiles install correctly on **Arch Linux**, **Debian**, and **Ubuntu** containers.

### 📱 Smart Screen Shot Operations

Implemented via **Hyprland**’s configuration, my Dotfiles provide a simple and efficient key‑binding scheme to define and execute screen capture areas and functionalities.

The following key combinations with the `PrtSc` key will execute a screen capture:

- `Shift`: Toggles between capturing the active window or the full screen
- `Ctrl`: Toggles between saving the capture or not
- `Alt`: Toggles between capturing a user-specified area or not

Additionally, the screen capture will always be saved to the clipboard, regardless of the above flags.

For example:

- `PrtSc`: Saves the active window to the clipboard
- `Shift` + `PrtSc`: Saves the full screen to the clipboard
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `PrtSc`: Saves a user-selected rectangular area to both the clipboard and a file

When saving to a file, the directory ~/me/pics/screenshot is automatically generated, with the subdirectory named after the current running process (e.g. ~/me/pics/screenshot/firefox).
