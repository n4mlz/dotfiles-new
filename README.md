This is my Dotfiles repository managed by **chezmoi**, targeting **Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu**!
This also provides a set of CLI tools, and can be deployed to SSH-accessible servers, WSL, or containers.

- [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) _**(Dotfiles Manager)**_

## ü™∂ Features

### ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic CLI tool installation

CLI tool‚Äëchain (such as **Starship**, **sheldon**, etc.) are installed automatically via chezmoi‚Äôs user‚Äëscript feature when you run `chezmoi apply`.

### üõ†Ô∏è CI‚Äëbased Installation Tests

GitHub Actions automatically verifies that these dotfiles install correctly on **Arch‚ÄØLinux**, **Debian**, and **Ubuntu** containers.

### üì± Smart Screen Shot Operations

Implemented via **Hyprland**‚Äôs configuration, my Dotfiles provide a simple and efficient key‚Äëbinding scheme to define and execute screen capture areas and functionalities.

The following key combinations with the `PrtSc` key will execute a screen capture:

- `Shift`: Toggles between capturing the active window or the full screen
- `Ctrl`: Toggles between saving the capture or not
- `Alt`: Toggles between capturing a user-specified area or not

Additionally, the screen capture will always be saved to the clipboard, regardless of the above flags.

For example:

- `PrtSc`: Saves the active window to the clipboard
- `Shift` + `PrtSc`: Saves the full screen to the clipboard
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `PrtSc`: Saves a user-selected rectangular area to both the clipboard and a file

When saving to a file, the directory ~/me/pics/screenshot is automatically generated, with the subdirectory named after the current running process (e.g. ~/me/pics/screenshot/firefox).
